# Exercise No. 1 - Israel Elections 2021

> Lecturer: Ziv Levy

ðŸ”´ **Due Date: 23/03/2021** ðŸ”´

## Overview & Purpose
In this exercise, youâ€™ll get to install the React Native development environment (in case you havenâ€™t done so already) and become more familiar and comfortable with your mobile development setup and coding.

The fun part: letâ€™s see if we can forecast the elections results, taking place on March 23rd, 2021!

## Objectives
* Show a list of valid parties for vote.
* Let users vote for a specific party.
* Let the users see whatâ€™s the current status of the 5 top ranked parties.

## How to Get It Done!
1. Follow the submission guidelines in the following address: https://github.com/zivl/mobile-app-development-s21/tree/master/guides
2. Thereâ€™s a server API which was built for this specific purpose, use the following API:
### API
Base URL: https://isr-elections.herokuapp.com/

Method: `GET` URL: `/api/parties`<br>
Description: Lists all the registered parties
Returns: `Array` in which every member of the array is of shape `{id: 'string'}`

Method: `POST` URL: `/api/parties/vote/:partyId`<br>
Description: Vote for a specific party by given `partyId`<br>
Params:
* `partyId`: *String* - the party id.<br>
`partyId` can be one of<br>
'likud' | 'yesh-atid' | 'kahol-lavan' | 'merez' | 'tikva-hadasha' | 'israel-beitenu' | 'shas' | 'yahadut-hatora' | 'meshutefet' | 'avoda' | 'zionut-datit' | 'gesher' | 'raam' | 'kalkalit'

Returns: `200 OK`

Method: `GET` URL: `/api/parties/poll-status`<br>
Description: Gets the current status of all *voted* parties. In case some party hasn't been voted, it will be omitted from the response<br>
Returns: `Object` which maps from `partyId` --> `Object` in the shape of `{ currentVotes: Number }`

## Screens
1. The first screen shows the user the parties he/she can vote. There will be a grid view of the parties in which each item in the grid consists of the partyâ€™s logo and the partyâ€™s official name as a caption of the logo.<br>
When the user presses to vote and the vote has been sent successfuly - a dialog message for the user will state that the vote has been accepted.<br>
See example image:

3. The second screen shows the top 5 ranked parties and the percentage of votes for each party. The list of parties should be ordered by the votes percentage in descending order

Note: Both screen should contain the same header component in which it has a title for the application and button to toggle between the two screens (Vote/Poll)
